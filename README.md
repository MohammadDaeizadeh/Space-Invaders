## 🛠️ How It Works

The game is built using standard C++ libraries and relies on terminal control codes for rendering. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Game Loop**: The main loop handles input, updates the game state, and renders the screen.  
- **Emoji Art**: Each entity (player, aliens, bullets) is represented by Emojis.  
- **Collision Detection**: Simple bounding box logic detects hits between bullets and aliens.  
- **Terminal Control**: ANSI escape codes are used to clear the screen and update the display dynamically.
